            <li>Once the necessary time has passed, drain the meat and eliminate the vegetables and herbs. You can cut the meat into smaller pieces if preferred.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Make the ragu</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large frying pan or skillet and fry the garlic, carrot, celery and onion slightly Add the bay leaves</li>
            <li>Add the wild boar meat and brown it on all sides.</li>
            <li>Add the red wine and let the alcohol evaporate.</li>
            <li>Lower the flame and cook for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato pulp/ peeled tomatoes and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook with the flame reduced to a minimum for about 1.5-2 hours (depending on the size of the pieces of wild boar and how old it is). Stir occasionally and add some beef stock or water if the sauce seems dry.</li>
            <li>While the ragu is cooking put a pot of water onto boil for the pasta. Add salt once it starts to boil and bring to the boil again. When you are ready to serve your wild boar ragu, cook the pasta al dente according to the instructions on the packet. Once ready, save a cup of the cooking water and drain the pasta.</li>
            <li>If you are reheating the ragu and it seems dry add some of the pasta cooking water. Remove the bay leaves and garlic cloves and add the pasta to the ragu and mix together carefully. You don’t want to break the pasta ribbons.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately. (Italians don’t normally add grated cheese to this dish or chopped parsley)</li>
        </ol>
