        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Making pasta is therapeutic and satisfying. It is a fun family activity or one to enjoy as a date night project. This is an easy recipe that you will come to when you crave those thick and delicious pappardelle pasta noodles. If you've never made fresh pasta this is a great recipe to get you started!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 eggs, (room temperature)</li>
            <li>400 g flour, 00 or plain all-purpose flour, (highly recommend weighing flour)</li>
            <li>Semolina flour, for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough. Sift the flour on a large work surface and make a well in the center (I like to use the bottom of a bowl to make the well). Place the eggs in a bowl, then pour into the well; with a fork, break up the eggs (like you are making scrambled eggs), then gradually mix the wet ingredients into the flour mixture just until combined. Start a little at a time and create a cake batter consistency then incorporate more of the flour until a crumble consistency form. The dough may look dry and crumbly at this point. (See Notes for more) If you have a dough scraper you can use it to help you incorporate the ingredients.</li>

            <li>Knead by hand. Dust a wooden board or work surface with flour. Start kneading each piece, push the dough away from you with the heel of your hand, fold the dough over itself and turn it counterclockwise. Continue pushing, folding, and turning until the dough is smooth and elastic about 10 minutes. You can also knead it in a stand mixer.</li>

            <li>Let dough Rest. Pat the dough into a round ball. Flatten the top slightly with your hand, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight. You will know your dough is ready when it springs back after you push into the dough. I call this the "spring back test".</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough. Sprinkle a large cutting board or clean the work surface with semolina. Cut Â¼ of the rested dough ball and keep the other part covered with plastic wrap so it doesn't dry.</li>
            <li>Rolling Pin Method: Starting in the middle, push away from you with a rolling pin, easing up on the pressure as you approach the edge. Dust both sides of the dough with a little semolina so it doesn't stick to the rolling pin and cutting board. Continue rolling the dough into a sheet, turning occasionally, until you can see your fingers through the bottom of the dough if you hold it to the light. Let the flat and rolled-out dough dry for about 10 minutes before cutting. You will repeat this step with all the pasta dough pieces.</li>
